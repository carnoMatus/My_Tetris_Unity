This is me learning Unity and making Tetris on the way.

The game itself is controlled using arrow keys, UP being used for tetromino rotation.

The implementation is not the most efficient, but for what it's worth I consider it readable and it works without any major issues. 

You can check the Unity project itself, or simply download the built application itself - the My_Tetris.zip file (the build is x64 for Windows).
